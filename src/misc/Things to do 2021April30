What needs to be fixed?
- Trips do not take third suit into consideration - score of 41444 means trip Aces and first two are spades, how do I fix this?
  The entire program is based on "score"
- Should I redo how scores work?
- They could be just three attributes of an object?
- Card has rank and suit
- Hand has - hand_value(1 to 20), hand_description(high card, pair, trip, straight, flush, house, 4K, SF, 5K, 6SF, 6K, etc),
    hand_suits(?),
